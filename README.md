Hi, my name is Aaron.

I love taking on challenging problems and I'm driven by the constant desire to learn.
I can quickly adapt to new technology and software.

For fun, I love learning about operating systems, compilers, networking, and low-level systems.
I also like tinkering with hobby electronics, pc gaming, and I run a homelab!

My discord is aar10n.
